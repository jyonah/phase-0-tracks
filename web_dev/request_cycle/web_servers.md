_What are some of the key design philosophies of the Linux operating system?_

  * What is perhaps the most important tennant of the Linux design philosophy is the idea that if you keep your user from doing stupid things, you also keep them from doing clever things as well, unlike Windows and MacOS operating sytems, which try and protect a user from the tools that might mess things up.
  
  * Other philosophies include making sure every program does _one thing, well._ Portiability over efficiency, to protoype as soon as possible, and small is beautiful.

_In your own words, what is a VPS (virtual private server)? What, according to your research, are the advantages of using a VPS?_

  * A Virtual Private Server is an instance of an operating system that can be installed on one or many actual machines, leaving room in those machines for /other/ servers. VPS' allow limited physical resources and machines to be shared among many people and projects, allowing more servers than there are machines. VPS' also allow for a certain portability and backup, companies like Amazon Web Services may have many copies of your VPS saved on several different machines in several different areas of the world. Running VPS' on such a service also allows for flexibility not only in storage size but in bandwith, and more machines can be dynamically provided to your server as it grows or demand to access it increasses.
