What is the purpose of HTML5 semantic tags? Which ones do you see as most useful?
	Semanitc tags are, in a way, predefined divs. They specifiy sections of a webpage that provide the ability to modify layout while also describing the purpose of the section. 

What is the order the browser uses to display elements on a page?
	The browser reads and renders the html document top to bottom.

What did you learn about Sublime in this challenge? Do you think you'll create more handy snippets at a later date?
	We learned to create snippets! I imageine down the road I'll use them to shorcut certain best practices held by myself or my team.

What concept in this challenge was most difficult for you? How can you improve your understanding of this concept?
	The <scope></scope> section of the snippet settup - it was not clear what this was for, and when we attempted to impliment it, it didn't work. We had to take it out in the end. I would attempt to improve my understanding by watching a tutroial video on youtube.
