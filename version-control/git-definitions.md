# Git Definitions

**Instructions: ** Define each of the following Git concepts.

*This is a small change*

* What is version control?  Why is it useful?

  Version control is a way to not only keep track of changes to a code base over time, but to let many developers work on the same codebase at the same time from different machines, but keep a backup of the master version. It's useful for bug tracking, fixing bugs, and getting a project done quickly by increasing manpower.

* What is a branch and why would you use one?

  A branch is a copy, or *version* of a codebase that should be used whenever edits are made to the codebase and merged with the master branch after it's been completed and tested.

* What is a commit? What makes a good commit message?

  A commit "ships" the changes to the git version control log - a good commit message describes what's different about the commited files than the original version.

* What is a merge conflict?

  A merge conflict is when a two branches have contrary information. Either because of work from annother developer at the same time or because changes made to the source data from the master branch during ones own work - your branch and the master have slightly different code.
